scripting vs programming language

JavaScript is a scripting language and every scripting language is programming language. But, still there are some small difference between scripting and programming language.

1. Scripting language interpreted and programming language is compiled.

Compilers and interpreters take human-readable code and convert it to computer-readable machine code.

Human readable code JavaScript, Python, java. > Interpretation or compilation > machine code.

*** For JavaScript several engine work for interpretation ex: v8, Spider monkey, chakra. ***

Major difference
===================
Interpreter reads line by line code and run.
Compilers translate the whole code at a time and then run.

Compiled code id more optimized and faster run on the other side Interpreted code is slow less optimized.

Interpreted languages were significantly slower than compiled languages.
But development of just-in-time compilation that gap is shrinking.

JavaScript is interpreted language but Interpretation and compilation are go side by side.
